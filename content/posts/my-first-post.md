Welcome to my website.  

I got the idea to start this adventure by reading [Paul Graham's blog](http://www.paulgraham.com). Besides creating the Lisp programming language and cofounding the startup accelerator YCombinator, he has a blog of his own. In a post he wrote about the difference of smart people and smart people who have lots of new ideas. Being smart doesn't necessarily mean you create new ideas.  

Paul argues that there are techniques you can use to come up with ideas. One of them is having your own projects besides school/work where you can be independent and learn in a way that resembles playing. (he calls it skating) Apparently many big companies started in this way. Another way to get new ideas is by writing down your thoughts. This will process them on a deeper level and organize them.

There are many ways to share creative things online nowadays. Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, GitHub, OpenSea and the list goes on. While these platforms give you access to a big audience, you are constrained by rules that determine how you express yourself. Having your own blog gives you a lot more freedom. I want to explore what things are fun to share on here like coding projects, thoughts about things I read online, or even share new ideas.

Let's see what this journey will bring.
