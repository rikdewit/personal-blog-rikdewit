This means it creates static html and css files which you then upload to your server to host them. It is a back to basics approach in a world where javascript bundle sizes are going through the roof. Not only does less javascript mean faster load times and a better experience. Less dependencies make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain your code as much. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a database to retrieve posts when you can just use html and links the way they were intended in the 90&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Writing a blog</title><link>https://blog.rikdewit.nl/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 22:52:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.rikdewit.nl/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Welcome to my website.
I got the idea to start this adventure by reading Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s blog. Besides creating the Lisp programming language and cofounding the startup accelerator YCombinator, he has a blog of his own. In a post he wrote about the difference between smart people and smart people who have lots of new ideas. Being smart doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean you create new ideas.
Paul argues that there are techniques you can use to come up with ideas.</description></item></channel></rss>
