I got the idea to start this adventure by reading Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s blog. Besides creating the Lisp programming language and cofounding the startup accelerator YCombinator, he has a blog of his own.

Paul argues that there are techniques you can use to come up with ideas.</description></item></channel></rss>
