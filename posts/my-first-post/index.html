<meta name=description content="Welcome to my website.
I got the idea to start this adventure by reading Paul Graham&rsquo;s blog. Besides creating the Lisp programming language and cofounding the startup accelerator YCombinator, he has a blog of his own. In a post he wrote about the difference between smart people and smart people who have lots of new ideas. Being smart doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you create new ideas.
